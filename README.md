## App overview

## Write down new list item
For your convenience an autocomplete is provided. It offers all items that have already appeared in the shopping list. The history of known items is stored in the json file data/list_items_history. Clearing or deleting this file results in clearing the autocomplete history as well.

If you add a new item and you happen to have an item of the same name in your shopping list, no new item is added, only the amount is updated. However, updating the item's amount can be done easier using the `edit button`.
